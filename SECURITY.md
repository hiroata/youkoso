- **Review dependencies** before adding new ones
- **Use dependency scanning** tools to identify vulnerabilities
- **Remove unused dependencies** to reduce attack surface

### Data Protection

- **Minimize data collection** to only what's necessary
- **Handle user data** according to privacy laws (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
